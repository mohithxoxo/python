    "We use Tkinter to build our calculator GUI.  Tkinter is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter offers a fast and easy way to create a GUI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The associated python code, `loan_calculator_GUI.py`, does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imports tkinter package for use\n",
    "2. Creates the main window (i.e., container)\n",
    "3. Adds widgets to the main window (calculation fields)\n",

    "## Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start calculating payments, you need to know what type of loan you’re using. Different loans require different calculations (or calculators). For example, with interest-only loans, you don’t pay down any debt in the early years—you only “service” the loan by paying interest. Other loans are amortizing loans, where you pay down the loan balance over a set period (such as a five-year auto loan).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formulas for Amortizing Loan Payment\n",
    "This approach works for most amortizing loans, which covers many popular loans except credit cards and interest-only loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$Loan Payment = Loan Amount / Discount Factor$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You need the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of Periodic Payments ($n$) = (Payments per year) $x$ (number of years)\n",
    "- Periodic Interest Rate ($i$) = (Annual rate) $/$  (number of payment periods per year)\n",
    "- Discount Factor ($D$) = $\\frac{[(1 + i) ^n] - 1}{[i(1 + i)^n]}$\n",
    "- Loan amount ($A$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation becomes:\n",
    "$P = A/D = A/\\frac{[(1 + i) ^n] - 1}{[i(1 + i)^n]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Loan Payment Calculation\n",
    "Assume you borrow $100,000 at 6% for 30 years, to be repaid monthly. What is the monthly payment?\n",
    "\n",
    "$n = 12*30 = 360$ (30 years times 12 monthly payments per year)\n",
    "\n",
    "$i = (6/100)/12 = .005$ (6% annually expressed as 0.06, divided by 12 monthly payments per year)\n",
    "\n",
    "$D = (([(1+.005)^360] - 1) / [0.005(1+.005)^360]) = 166.7916$\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = 100000$\n",
    "\n",
    "$P = A / D = 100,000 / 166.7916 = 599.55$\n",
    "\n",
    "The monthly payment is $599.55. Check your math with the Python GUI payment calculator.\n",

    "4. In the terminal with the activated environment type `python loan_calculator_GUI.py`\n",
